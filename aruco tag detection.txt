As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, OpenCV's ArUco library is an open-source library for detection of ArUco markers. The implementation details might have changed if there have been updates to OpenCV since then. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please refer to the OpenCV documentation or the source code directly.

Here's a general overview based on the information available up to my last update:

1. **Marker Generation:**
   ArUco markers are typically generated with specific patterns that encode information. The library provides functions to generate these markers with varying sizes, dictionaries, and other parameters.

2. **Camera Calibration:**
   Before using ArUco marker detection, it is common to calibrate the camera. Camera calibration involves capturing images of a calibration pattern and obtaining the camera intrinsic matrix, distortion coefficients, etc. The calibration results are essential for accurate marker pose estimation.

3. **Marker Detection:**
   The detection process involves several steps:

   - **Image Preprocessing:**
     The input image is often preprocessed to enhance marker visibility. This may include operations like blurring, thresholding, and edge detection.

   - **Contour Detection:**
     Contours in the image are found to identify potential marker regions.

   - **Marker Identification:**
     The library searches for the specific patterns that define ArUco markers. The library supports various dictionary types, and the markers are identified based on their encoded patterns.

   - **Pose Estimation:**
     Once a marker is detected, the library performs pose estimation to determine the marker's position and orientation in 3D space. This involves solving the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem using the camera matrix and distortion coefficients obtained during calibration.

   - **Decoding Information:**
     ArUco markers often encode information, and the library provides functions to decode this information.

4. **Visualization:**
   Optionally, the library may provide functions for visualizing the detected markers, their IDs, and their poses in the input image or the 3D space.

To get detailed information, you should check the official OpenCV documentation for the ArUco module. The documentation includes explanations of functions, usage examples, and sometimes even references to relevant research papers or algorithms. If you're interested in the actual implementation details, you can explore the source code for the ArUco module within the OpenCV GitHub repository.
